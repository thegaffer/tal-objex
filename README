Objex is a framework for creating rich OO domains. Rather than try to 
aggregate all data together, Objex recognises that the natural structure of
information in many enterprises is that of a document or folder. Therefore,
it groups the objects in this way and maps that to a variety of database
structures.

Objex is currently written in Java to allow you to build rich domains 
easily in Java without the persistence world leaking into your objects. 
Earlier versions were written in C++ and the language objex is written in
is relatively unimportant vs its concepts.

Status: This is a personal project, something I have turned to a number of
times during my real career to explore some ideas. It is not currently a
goal of mine to "finish" this project (whatever that means), its main 
purpose is to convey my thoughts and ideas - so I'd be happy to discuss 
these further.
