/**
 * This package contains domain/business objects that directly implement
 * the {@link org.talframework.objexj.ObjexObj} interface, via the
 * {@link org.talframework.objexj.object.BaseObjexObj} class. These are
 * used in the tests and serve as a demonstration/usage of this model.
 * Note, however, there are generators that aim to make the task of
 * implementing ObjexObj from your objects even simpler.
