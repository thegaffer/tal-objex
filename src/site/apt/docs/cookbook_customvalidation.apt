How To Implement Custom Validation

  Sorry, I've not written this yet. This will be a guide to writing a custom
  validation support in your objects directly (by-passing the 303 mechanism)
  
  To be honest, I'm not sure I am ever going to write this because although it
  is possible why would you not use JSR 303??
