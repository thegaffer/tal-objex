  The first main runtime environment I've targetted is the Google App Engine. The main
  reason for this is the data storage engine is not based on a RDBMS and, therefore,
  shows how Objex can be used in such an environment. Also the unique constraints about
  transactions on the Google App Engine play nicely into the strengths of Objex and
  its view about Containers, particularly Document Containers.
