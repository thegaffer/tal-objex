The Relation DB Motivation

--- WIP ---

* How I (Might) View Data

 Lets imagine a fairly typical simple company. The company sells things.
 Each time is makes a sale it is called an order. The order consists of
 order items that relate to stock items. The order also contains other
 elements such as the name and address of the customer.
 
 For the majority of the time I will want to access this data order by 
 order. I will typically know the order I want to work with, typically
 because I created it, and then work with the objects in that order.
 Therefore, I see no relationship between order items in one order and
 order items in another order. Crucially I do not want to be slowed
 down by the weight of other order items that exist.
 
 There will seperately be some searches that I will explictly want to
 perform. For instance tell me 
 
 On top of this there are some Business Intelligence (BI) queries I 
 might want to perform. For instance give me all the orders above a
 certain value for the day, and given 
 
 


 I live in a house on a street in a town. My house is made up of lots of
 things. Notably bricks, tiles, windows, carpets etc, etc. My house 
 references some other houses. Most directly it references the houses to
 either side (my neighbours), but also in my house is an address book 
 where you can find my brothers house (who is in the same town).
 
 In terms of the processes that I engage with in this town I simply 
 navigate (drive or walk) to the street and house I need. For instance
 to visit my brother I go to his house, to go shopping I go to the
 house (or building) the shop is in.
 
* How a RDBMS Views the same Data

 A RDBMS does not view the data in this way. Instead it takes all of the
 town and then takes every apart. It then places everything that is the
 same type of thing together. So all of the bricks are placed together,
 all of the tiles are placed together, all of the windows are placed
 together ... you get the picture. Of course references are still made
 to link these items together (primary and foreign keys).
 
 The real point to this analogy is that the data is now now organised
 in a way that is natural for me to live. Sure there will be some processes
 that would like to say find me all houses in my town that have more than
 20 windows - and here of course a RDBMS is well suited - but for most
 life the RDBMS's view would simply slow me down.
 
* Key Points

** Data Access

 For basic data access I would argue that the RDBMS data is not arranged
 how I am likely to want to access it. 
 
 The RDBMS is structured to allow me to query across all the data set, i.e.
 find me all the houses in my town with more than 20 windows. There will be
 applications that wish to make such queries, and so RDBMS is clearly a
 strong candidate. But for the processes I typically engage
