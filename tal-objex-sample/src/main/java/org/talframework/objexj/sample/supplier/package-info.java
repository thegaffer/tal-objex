 * This package is the root package for our suppliers document.
 * A supplier document describes a supplier our fictional company
 * deals with, including addresses, people and other details.
 * 
 * <p>As with other containers in our sample app, the api 
 * sub-package holds the API we use, the domain sub-package
 * holds our actual domain/behavioural object implementation
 * and there is a service in the root package to interact with.
 * Note that aside from the service implementation there is no
 * use of Objex in our code.</p>
